# Dragon-Repeller-RPG
A simple game to hunt beasts and dragons. 


Dragon Repeller is a fun, browser-based mini RPG built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this simple text-and-button adventure, you battle monsters, earn gold and XP, and upgrade your gear until you're powerful enough to defeat the mighty dragon!

No frameworks. No libraries. Just classic web dev fun.

(❁´◡`❁)Gameplay Overview
You start your journey in the Town Square, armed with a humble stick, 100 health, and 50 gold. Choose your path wisely:

Go to Store: Buy health or upgrade your weapon (or sell one).

Go to Cave: Fight progressively tougher monsters to earn XP and gold.

Fight Dragon: Take on the final boss... if you dare.

Along the way, you’ll:

Battle monsters like slimes and fanged beasts.

Upgrade weapons from a stick to a deadly sword.

Find a secret easter egg game to win extra rewards (or suffer losses).

Replay as many times as you want after winning or losing.
